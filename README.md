# NIOT-IMS
 
Project Description:
NIOT IMS (RFID Inventory Management System) is a cutting-edge web application designed to facilitate seamless inventory tracking within a single building using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. With its advanced features and intuitive interface, NIOT IMS provides administrators with robust tools to monitor and manage inventory levels efficiently.

Key Features:

1. RFID Tag Integration: The system integrates RFID tags with inventory items, allowing for automated tracking and identification. Each item is equipped with an RFID tag containing unique identification information, enabling precise inventory management.
2. Real-time Inventory Tracking: NIOT IMS provides real-time updates on inventory movements and locations using RFID technology. Administrators can monitor inventory levels and track the movement of items within the building in real time.
3. Room-wise Inventory Management: Inventory items are organized and managed based on the rooms in which they are located. Administrators can assign RFID-tagged items to specific rooms and easily track their whereabouts within the building.
4. RFID Reader Integration: The application interfaces with RFID readers installed in various locations within the building. These RFID readers capture data from RFID tags attached to inventory items, enabling automatic inventory tracking without manual intervention.
5. Customizable Alerts and Notifications: Administrators can configure customized alerts and notifications to receive updates on inventory-related events, such as low stock levels, item movement, or unauthorized access. This proactive approach to inventory management helps prevent stockouts and reduces inventory shrinkage.
6. Reporting and Analytics: NIOT IMS offers comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities to analyze inventory data and identify trends. Users can generate customizable reports on inventory levels, item movements, and usage patterns to make informed decisions and optimize inventory management strategies.
7. User Management: The system provides role-based access control, allowing administrators to define user roles and permissions. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive inventory data and perform specific actions, enhancing data security and integrity.
8. Responsive Design: Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, NIOT IMS features a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and devices. Users can access the application from desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, facilitating flexibility and accessibility.
9. Interactive User Interface: The user interface is designed with a focus on usability and intuitiveness, featuring interactive elements and smooth navigation. Users can easily browse inventory items, track their movements, and perform actions with minimal effort.
